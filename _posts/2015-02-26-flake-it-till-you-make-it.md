Hi there. 

My name is Qaiser and I'm a Scrum Master. Saying that feels weird to me because I wasn't always one, I used to be a technical lead. That also feels weird as technically I'm still a tech lead until Tuesday 15th March 2016. 

I'm going to use my github pages account to host a blog that will chronicle the journey of me moving from a development role to one with less coding. I've purposely put it like that because as a tech lead without a scrum master in the team you end up doing a lot of the scrum master stuff anyway.

I'll also use this blog to keep track of the interesting code I find or write. The code I write is rarely interesting, I like to keep things as simple and robust as possible however, I'll be writing most of [Swoop's](http://www.swooprecruit.com) code and I've mostly worked on the back-end. The front-end work should be "interesting" for me to write. I'll share how I get on.
